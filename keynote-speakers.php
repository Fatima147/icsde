Professor, Technical University of Munich, Germany<br></p>
<p align="justify">Michael Gerndt received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1989 from the University of Bonn. He developed SUPERB the first automatic parallelizer for distributed memory parallel machines. For two years, in 1990 and 1991, he held a postdoc position at the University of Vienna and joined Research Centre Juelich in 1992 where he concentrated on programming and implementation issues of shared virtual memory systems. This research led to his habilitation in 1998 at Technische Universität München (TUM). Since 2000 he is professor for architecture of parallel and distributed systems at TUM. His current research focuses on programming models and tools for scalable parallel architectures. He is leading the development of the automatic performance analysis tools Periscope and of iOMP, an extension of OpenMP for invasive computing. iOMP is a research project in the new Transregional Collaborative Research Center InvasIC (TR 89) funded by the German Science Foundation. In addition he is heading projects on parallel programming languages and their implementation on multicore processors as well as resource management in Cloud environments funded by public and industry sources. Since October 2011 he is the coordinator of the European FP7 project AutoTune on automatic online tuning.
