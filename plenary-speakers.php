																style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">
																Over the coming 10 years, the 5G ecosystem will allow
																every industry to move from an unconnected physical
																world to a fully digitalized and mobilized
																situation.&nbsp; With 5G we will move beyond
																smartphones, tablets and TV into a world of the IoT,
																smart meters, connected cars and potentially billions of
																other devices in other industries. The capabilities of
																5G wireless access must extend far beyond previous
																generations of mobile communication. Examples of these
																capabilities include very high data rates, very low
																latency, ultra-high reliability, energy efficiency and
																extreme device densities,<br /> <br /> 5G will provide
																a&nbsp; common network platform - one physical network
																with multiple logical networks on top of it - that is
																dynamically set up in a secure way to give industries
																what they need.&nbsp; It will be able to connect any
																industry with any end point, whether a device, sensor or
																automobile.<br /> <br /> We&#39;ll see new
																as-a-service business models based on this network
																slicing, which, in the context of 5G, will be like
																virtual networks on-demand. Workloads will also move
																further out in the infrastructure to support new use
																cases that require better user experience or higher
																efficiency, in what we call distributed cloud.<br /> <br />
																Distributed cloud will also be key to supporting the
																Internet of Things, which has developed in two primary
																ways. The first is through miniaturization, cloud
																solutions, faster processing speeds, and the dawn of big
																data and data analytics have allowed companies to
																benefit from real-time data collected from the physical
																environment. Second, decreasing component costs and
																cheaper data collection methods have altered the
																cost-benefit model, making IoT solutions feasible for
																more enterprises and industries.

																		the Wireless Terabit/s</strong></span><br /> <br /> <span
																	style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The
																	data rate of wireless access technology has been
																	increasing by 10x every 5 years. At the start of 5G it
																	will be surpassing 1Gb/s for cellular, and 100Gb/s for
																	WLAN access. Hence, data rates of 1Tb/s for wireless
																	access are coming into sight. This creates the
																	challenge of how to achieve a low-power modem solution
																	at these ever increasing data rates. If, e.g., powered
																	by USB or power-over-Ethernet, a modem may only have
																	available power budget of a few Watt. However, does
																	digital signal processing, analog/digital conversion,
																	or the RF transceiver pose the bottleneck? It turns out
																	that alone traditional linear modulation and Nyquist
																	sampling leads to a required power consumption for
																	analog/digital conversion far beyond the available
																	budget. Do we have to re-engineer our modems? Do we
																	need to re-invent system theory for nonlinear
																	operations? Some first answers shall be given, showing
																	a pathway towards the feasibility of achieving 1Tb/s
																	wireless. Let&rsquo;s prepare for the 5G WLAN and 6G
																	cellular speeds!</span><br /> <br /> <span

															<strong>A Platform Approach to 5G&nbsp;</strong><br />
															<div>
																5G promises a transformation in the way industries do
																business and consumers live their lives with wealth of
																new features and capabilities compared to today&rsquo;s
																status quo.&nbsp; Reviewing the timeline and potential
																launch of 5G technologies and services, the tasks ahead
																coupled of the enormous complexity of the work renders
																traditional approaches obsolete.&nbsp; Any new
																transformation especially one of this magnitude must
																follow a systematic process to deliver on the
																promise.&nbsp; New approaches are needed to compress the
																time from concept to commercialization otherwise
																introductions may be delayed, investments may skyrocket,
																or a combination of both.&nbsp; NI proposes a platform
																based approach to speed time to market that combines an
																innovative approach to system design with logical and
																efficient transitions to the testing of these new
																technologies in the product development and
																commercialization phases.&nbsp; Providing innovative
																platform components encompassing both hardware and
																software for prototyping this approach can be extended
																to product development by reusing these components in a
																number of different ways to break down the conventional
																barriers between design and test.&nbsp; This approach
																also facilitates more active collaboration between
																researchers and product teams to solve tough business
																challenges and accelerate the path to a connected 5G
																landscape.<br /> <br /> <br /> Since joining NI in
																1997, Starkloff has held leadership positions across the
																marketing organization, including leading teams that
																pioneered industry adoption of systems platforms such as
																PXI and CompactRIO.<br /> Starkloff invests his time in
																science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
																education by serving on the advisory board for the
																Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer
																Engineering at Virginia Tech and the board of directors
																for Urban Roots, an Austin-based sustainable agriculture
																program to transform the lives of young people.

																	<br /> 2018 promises to be a transitional year for 5G.
																	Air interface and core network concepts defined both on
																	a proprietary basis and by pre-standards forums will be
																	deployed in trial configurations at scale. This will
																	allow direct field performance assessment of 5G
																	enhanced mobile broadband services at both sub-6GHz and
																	mm-wave frequencies, and point the way towards
																	commercial 5G deployments and services. This
																	presentation there will first assess the resulting
																	state-of-the-art in 5G air interface design, including
																	the technical components and schedule of the emerging
																	3GPP New Radio specification. We then consider, on a
																	regional basis, the state of global 5G spectrum
																	availability including access mechanisms and
																	coexistence requirements before moving to assess
																	current progress and key challenges in implementing 5G,
																	including trends in silicon, in RF and baseband
																	implementations in devices and radio access
																	infrastructure, and in core network design. We close
																	with a look forward to the critical 2018-2020 period,
																	when the world&rsquo;s first operational 5G systems
																	will emerge.<br /> <br /> <strong>Asha R.
